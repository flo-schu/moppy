    Parameters
    ----------
    x_in : xr.Dataset
        The input dataset which contains a coordinate (x) and a data variable
        (y)
    x : str, optional
        The name of the x coordinate, by default "time"
    factor : float, optional
        The distance between the newly added points and the following existing
        points on the x-scale, by default 1e-4
    interpolation : Literal["fill-forward", "linear"], optional
        The interpolation method. In addition to 'fill-forward' and 'linear',
        any method give in `xr.interpolate_na` can be chosen, by default
        "fill-forward"

    Returns
    -------
    xr.Dataset
        The interpolated dataset
